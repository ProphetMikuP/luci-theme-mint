# The random wallpaper APIs answer every request with a 302 redirect to a
# DIFFERENT image, so the browser HTTP cache can never pin one picture:
# even with the frontend's sessionStorage URL cache each navigation
# followed the redirect to a fresh image. This script makes the ROUTER
# resolve the randomness: every CACHE_PERIOD minutes it fetches one image
# per device class (pc / mobile) into /www/luci-static/mint/ and the
# frontends then reference the stable local file. uhttpd serves it with a
# Last-Modified header, so browsers reuse it (304) until the file changes
# - exactly the 5-minute cache window requested.
#
# Files written:
#   /www/luci-static/mint/wallpaper-pc.img
#   /www/luci-static/mint/wallpaper-mobile.img
#
# Only used when the matching UCI mode is "random"; custom images ignore
# the proxy files entirely.
